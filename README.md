# record_playing_tracker
Web app to track when and how often each of my records are played

For now, view at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Currently this is a full list of my records with the ability to mark when one is played. Database records can also be added, updated, and deleted.

Future features:

- Sort order (so albums within an artist's catalog sort in the order you prefer, not by ID)
- Album artwork
- Recommendtion on what record to play
- Discogs link
