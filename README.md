# record_playing_tracker
Web app to track when and how often each of my records are played

For now, view at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Currently this is a full list of my records with the ability to mark when one is played. Database records can also be added, updated, and deleted.

Future features:

- Display artist name and backend artist name to help with sorting and showing artists (example display The Smashing Pumpkins or Smashing Pumpkins depending on the album, but in the backend, always sort just by Smashing Pumpkins)
- Album artwork
- Discogs link
- Pull in price from Discogs API
- Record recommendor - add checkbox to avoid singles and EPs
- Show user the query they wrote when Custom SQL functionality is used
