# record_playing_tracker
Web app to track when and how often each of my records are played

For now, view at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Currently this is a full list of my records with the ability to mark when one is played. Database records can also be added, updated, and deleted.

Future features:

- Album artwork
- Discogs link
- Record recommender - add checkbox to avoid singles and EPs
- Show user the query they wrote when Custom SQL functionality is used
